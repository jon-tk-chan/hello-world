# hello-world

first project 

written on December 10, 2018 in 11C ellipsis tower (Hong Kong). To future Jon: I hope you are a better programmer than the one 
who took 6 tries (and counting) to finish the first quiz from Crafting Quality Code. Also I hope you are taking the 
time to enjoy your life for once. 

Take care.
